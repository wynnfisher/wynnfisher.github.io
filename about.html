        Hello! My name is Wynn. I am from South Kingstown, Rhode Island.
        My hobbies include fencing and volunteering as an EMT. 
        I currently have no pets, but I used to have a bunny rabbit who was very cute.    
                <br>
        I like to travel. Last year I went abroad for a semester in Hong Kong. 
        I also visited China and Korea while in Asia.
        This summer want to spend a lot of time reading and painting.
            <br>
        I'm a senior currently studying anthropology and history. 
        After I graduate from URI I hope to go to grad school for archaeology and become an archaeologist.
        I hope that learning programming will help me 
        <br>        
        create and navigate databases that can be used 
        for research in archaeology.
